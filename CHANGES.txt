if an NMI interrupted PRG bank change
it could crash the game. Fixed.

last pop wasn't setting the default
PRG bank back into place. Fixed.

Minor other changes
-crt0.s
-neslib.s

set_nmi_chr_tile_bank() and
unset_nmi_chr_tile_bank() have been removed.

CHR banks will automatically be set at
the top of each frame.

If you need to do a split screen with CHR
bank changes, then after the sprite zero hit
use these functions...

split_chr_bank_0() or split_chr_bank_1()

which will temporarily change the CHR bank
until the next NMI is reached.
