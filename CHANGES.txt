if an NMI interrupted PRG bank change
it could crash the game. Fixed.

last pop wasn't setting the default
PRG bank back into place. Fixed.

Minor other changes (crt0.s)

if an NMI interrupts a CHR bank change
it could also cause problems. You should
only change CHR banks near the beginning
of the frame (right after ppu_wait_nmi or
ppu_wait_frame or ppu_off or ppu_on...)
